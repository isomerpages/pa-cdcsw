It aims to facilitate and promote youth volunteerism, a sense of community ownership and belonging, and to enhance capabilities among the youth.

Projects must:

*   supported by a grassroots organisation;
*   Benefit the South West community and engage at least 50 beneficiaries; and
*   Each project must be initiated by a team of at least 5 members; aged 35 and below.
