**WeCare Arts Experiences @ South West**

WeCare Arts Experiences is a funding programme by the National Arts Council and People’s Association. The fund aims to bring arts into the community by providing residents from less privileged backgrounds access to ticketed arts and cultural experiences that are specially curated by the National Arts Council and cultural institutions. Beneficiaries are encouraged to attend with immediate family members, caregivers or befrienders to bond over a shared arts experience and strengthen social ties.

The fund supports tickets of up to $40 each (excluding ticketing fees), transportation and light refreshments for

* beneficiaries who are recipients of SSA’s services and assistance;
* beneficiaries who receive financial and social assistance support from community partners;
* immediate family of beneficiaries; and
* volunteers who accompany beneficiaries to the arts experiences.
