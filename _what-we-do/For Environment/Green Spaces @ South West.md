**Green Spaces @ South West**

Ten years of nurturing greenery and community ties culminate in the milestone celebration of achieving 1,000,000 Native Plants @ South West, which saw more than one million native plants seeded across more than 150 gardens in the district by more than 3,000 community gardeners over 10 years.  
  
Succeeding 1,000,000 Native Plants @ South West, Green Spaces @ South West will grow an inclusive, caring and active community by transforming community gardens into green spaces that promote:  
  
**Life** \- where community gardens are inclusive, aesthetic and productive, and are open to all.  
  
**Learn** \- where garden volunteers gain relevant and new knowledge to enhance the community experience in these green spaces.  
  
**Love** \- where residents care and share for the vulnerable, who can be meaningfully engaged at these spaces and enjoy the garden harvest together.

If you are keen to seek funding support for your green spaces, please see the following: 

**A one-time seed funding:** for gardening groups as follows:

*   $3,000 per GRO;
*   $1,000 per school or SSA;
*   $500 per NC;
*   $1,500 for Garden Expansion Fund (expansion projects must be at least half the plot size of the existing garden and/or 50% more plant species).

**Garden Activity Grant:** activity fund of $500 will be provided for Gardening Groups for the organisation of South West District tours and activities for the community for at least 30 pax for each session. Activities should be related to greening and gardening and benefit the community.

**Therapeutic Horticulture Nodes @ South West**: a grant of $250 will be provided to gardening groups under this programme to help in material costs for the therapeutic sessions catering to 10 - 15 pax. 

**Adopt-A-Garden @ South West:** corporations and organisations can adopt gardens by sponsoring a part of the community gardens’ expenses or donating furniture and tools. They can also volunteer and help out at the community gardens on a regular basis, deepening engagement with residents and fostering community bonds. The CDC will assist to do the matching of community gardens.
