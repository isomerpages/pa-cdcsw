During the circuit breaker period, to keep our elderly community gardeners engaged, we produced a series of at-home gardening videos, guiding them to plant okra, tomato and _kang kong_ at home, and share their progress with their fellow gardeners on social media. The seeds were provided to the community gardeners thanks to our corporate sponsor Ricoh. We wanted the videos to be a way to empower our senior community gardeners to stay home, stay safe and stay engaged with the community. Check out the videos and see if you have a green thumb too!
