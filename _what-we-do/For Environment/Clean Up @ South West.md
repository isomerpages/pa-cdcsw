<p><strong>Recent programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Clean Up @ South West 2024 took place on Saturday, 28 January 2024 at
Westgate. More than 50 community recycling points were set up across the
district to encourage residents to donate their recyclables such as clothes,
paper and newspaper in exchange for groceries, as part of Clean Up @ South
West 2024. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To raise awareness of the importance of food security, sustainability
and nutritional health among students, the CDC launched a set of activity
booklets in partnership with Life3 Biotech Pte Ltd, as part of GROW @ South
West.</p>

<p>The booklets were specially curated for primary and secondary school students
and cover key messages on reducing food waste, eating healthy, maintaining
good hygiene, practicing the 3Rs – reduce, reuse and recycle and reducing
our carbon footprints.</p>
<p>This year, the CDC presented the Sustainable South West Awards 2023 to
four winners. The Sustainable South West Awards recognises schools, community
and corporate organisations which have made exemplary contributions towards
environmental sustainability in the South West District and to the Sustainable
South West Masterplan. These efforts encompass ground up initiatives that
actively engage residents and community partners in addressing environmental
and sustainability challenges within the South West District.</p>
