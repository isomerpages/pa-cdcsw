**Share-Your-Book @ South West** is an initiative by South West CDC, in collaboration with ALBA W&H and Sharetings, to encourage residents to donate their story books in good conditions to community libraries or reading corners in the district. Through the mobile sharing app, Sharetings, residents can choose to donate their story books to the participating Community Libraries @ RCs and reading corners directly, or continue to exchange books with one another via the app. Residents who donated their story books can earn recycling points on ALBA STEP UP mobile app which can be used to redeem vouchers or discounts from participating retailers.  
  
Donated books can also go towards supporting a good cause to benefit vulnerable residents as part of the CDC's efforts in promoting a caring community.
