Green Trails @ South West, a collaboration with the South West CDC, NTU Earthlink, National Parks and the community to co-create Trails, with South West’s community gardens as checkpoints. Using a digital passport, residents can scan the QR codes at the gardens to download stories and fun facts about the gardens, answer questions and upload photos of themselves at the gardens.  Green Trails @ South West initiative will be piloted in Chua Chu Kang GRC with four community gardens in Bukit Gombak and gradually be expanded to include more community gardens in the district. 

We hope to encourage our residents to adopt a healthier lifestyle by walking and discover interesting facts about our community gardens. This initiative is also aligned with “Our Green Ride” pillar of our Sustainable South West Master Plan, for a car-lite community.

Michelman Singapore will contribute $25,000 for the Green Trail that will go towards supporting 1,000 vulnerable families with grocery packs to help them with daily expenses. For every person who completes the trail, $25 will be donated to support these families.
