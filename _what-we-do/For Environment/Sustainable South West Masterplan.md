The **Sustainable South West (SSW)** is a sustainability masterplan that will steer the district's sustainability efforts in the next 10 years, to build a more liveable and sustainable South West District. SSW aims to nurture a community that is environmentally conscious, practises an eco-lifestyle and demonstrates community ownership.

Developed by the community for the community, the SSW is a culmination of voices, views and input from South West residents from all walks of life.
