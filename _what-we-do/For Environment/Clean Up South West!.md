**Recent Programme**

Clean Up South West! 2022 took place on Sunday, 16 January 2022 at Hillview Community Club with the focus to “Reuse, before Recycling”. Guest-of-honour, Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Trade and Industry and Adviser to Chua Chu Kang GRC GROs launched the Share-Your-Book @ South West initiative.  

The Share-Your-Book @ South West initiative is a collaboration with Sharetings and ALBA E-Waste, where residents can donate their pre-loved books to over 14 Community Library @ RCs and reading corners located in the South West District. Residents will be able to use the Sharetings mobile app to donate pre-loved books, while ALBA will provide CO2 points when people bring their recyclables to any of ALBA’s bins. CO2 points accumulated on ALBA STEP Up app can be exchanged for rewards such as e-vouchers for eco-friendly products.

Mayor of South West District, Ms Low Yen Ling said, “We hope the Share-Your-Book @ South West initiative will give residents a chance to share their pre-loved books and keep them in use for longer, and reduce the amount of waste produced. If more things can be reused even before recycling, the levels of waste will come down. Having little book-sharing communities across our district will contribute to a growing culture of sharing and reusing that supports our South West district’s goal to be a Zero Waste community.”
