**Collaboration – Zero Waste Testbed Initiative**

The Zero Waste Testbed Initiative is organised by NUS and South West Community Development Council to empower and support youths in the co-creation of innovative solutions towards zero waste and circular economy through test-bedding of proof-of-concepts within the NUS campus.

This is an opportunity for teams to obtain up to **$10,000 in project funding** and **mentorship** by industry and government practitioners in the implementation of their ideas. 

**ONGOING CALL: BEHAVIOURAL EDUCATION FOR RECYCLING RIGHT FROM YOUNG** 

![ZWTI](/images/What%20We%20Do/For%20Environment/ZWTI%20Poster%20(Final).png)


Developing a recycling habit should ideally start from young. Beyond an information-based education for recycling, taking a behaviourally-informed approach could more effectively develop good habits.

According to Daniel Kahneman’s theory of human behaviour, people have two systems of thinking where System 1 is automatic, fast and concrete (e.g. imagine stopping quickly upon seeing the red man at a traffic light junction) while System 2 is slow, effortful and abstract (e.g. imagine mentally trying to compute “239 x 123”). This dual system theory can explain people’s habits on recycling (or lack of).

People might use heuristics (or simple rule of thumbs) to decide what can be recycled. Given people’s busy routines, it is unlikely that they will stop in their tracks to read and understand the labels on recycling bins, or search on the internet what can be recycled (System 2). Instead, they might use their immediate senses (e.g. sight, touch) and abstract thinking (e.g. paper, plastic categories) to determine if an item is recyclable (System 1), resulting in contamination in recycling bins.

**How can a project be designed to shape habits and address behavioural heuristics for primary school students so that they can recycle more and recycle right in the school and/or at home?** Applicants need not have behavioural science background and may curate multiple ideas in a project.

**Can I apply?**

Applicants are to fulfil the below criteria:

* Open to individuals or groups

* All group members must be 17 – 35 years old

* At least one of the group members must be a Singaporean or Permanent Resident

* At least one of the group members must be a prospective student, full-time student or alumni of NUS (eligible upon receipt of offer of admission for prospective NUS students)

* Applicants may engage on their own or seek support from NUS and South West CDC on the primary school to carry out the pilot implementation, of which must be in the South West District (to check if the location falls within the South West District, visit [www.pa.gov.sg](http://www.pa.gov.sg) and insert the postal code under ‘District Information’ at the bottom of the webpage)

For topics, applicants can refer to the other problem statements below, as well as the awarded projects on Recycling Right, Promoting Reuse and Waste to Resource for reference.

**1\. Design for Recycle Right: Zero Contamination**

  
The [Recycle Right bins](https://nus.edu.sg/zerowaste/recycling-right-with-new-bin-design/) with behaviourally-informed design have shown to be effective in getting people to recycle right, with contamination rates of plastic bottle recycling bin reducing by more than half in both a campus and public space (shopping mall) setting. The bins have the following key features:

a.       A clear display with actual non-recyclables that highlights concretely what should not be placed inside the recycling bins

b.       A slidable opening lid that adds friction to reduce mindless, habitual throwing of non-recyclables

c.       A transparent bin body that showcases the accumulated clean recyclables

The current bins are made of mostly powder-coated mild steel, except for the display and body which are made of acrylic. This design and materials have contributed to its aesthetic look, but its cost is higher than that of plastic. However, the production of plastic bins requires a high upfront cost of a plastic mould.

**With the objective of retaining the key features/intentions of the bins that have resulted in its behavioural efficacy, how might a new bin be designed (e.g. innovative design to reduce material use or alternative materials) to be implemented in more premises (e.g. schools) (i) at a lower production cost and/or (ii) drive the contamination rate towards zero?**

**2\. Designing for Reusable Habit in F&B Outlets**

NUS plans to phase out key takeaway disposables (e.g. PP5 cups and paper-based containers) in canteens by 2025, which comprise a sizeable component of the waste sent for incineration that is not accepted by industry for recycling. To support this policy implementation, a convenient and operationally feasible reusable rental system will be implemented to facilitate ease of return – this had been piloted in the first scenario call of the Zero Waste Testbed Initiative at NUS Techno Edge canteen. In addition, the user experience of the system needs to facilitate the repetition of the behaviour for habit formation. 

_a._       _Reusable cup design_

A pleasant experience of using a reusable cup could encourage subsequent use. Cups also have operational requirements from stallholders and central cleaning facilities. For example, cups for fruit juice stalls require transparency to identify the type of drink easily and include a reusable straw for ice-blended drinks. Cups for hot drinks should prevent scalding when held and made of a light material for ease of collection. As all the reusable cups are steam-washed centrally by machines, the design should have minimal gaps (e.g. at the screw lid or mouth of cup) to minimise accumulation of dirt for easy washing.

**How might a reusable cup be designed to meet the above requirements to improve its versatility and provide a pleasant experience for the user?** Applicants are expected to produce a mock-up design (e.g. through 3D printing) for preliminary evaluation.

_b._       _Behavioural-based “reward” scheme for everyday habit_

Renting a reusable or bringing one’s own reusable for takeaways in a canteen requires some intrinsic effort to overcome status quo inertia and sufficient repetition to become an automatic routine (i.e. a habit). To encourage habit formation, one way is to surprise users with random or intermittent small rewards to spur repetition. A large one makes the behaviour largely contingent on the rewards – when the rewards are removed, the desired behaviour likely discontinues.

**How might a reward scheme be designed to encourage habit formation that can be operationalised in an NUS canteen?** Applicants are expected to also conduct behavioural data measurements over a period of time to quantify the efficacy of the scheme.

_UGo team members: (from left to right) Daniel Foong (Engineering), Lim An Qi (Engineering), Liaw Ann Shin (Environmental Studies), Toh Sihui (Computing) and Celeste Ong (Marketing)._ 

The team, UGo, aimed to get the community to reduce disposable usage by introducing a reusable rental system that was convenient for users and has a tracking system to minimise the loss of reusables. Piloted in Techno Edge Canteen from January to May 2022, the team had leveraged their various skill sets and developed a system that comprised an app to track the borrowing and returning of reusables, return bins that were conveniently placed in faculties near Techno Edge canteen and a marketing campaign to create a positive experience of the initiative. At the end of the pilot, over 800 reusables were used, with a high return rate of over 95%.

Converting Waste to Resource: Upcycling Fruit Peel Waste to EcoEnzyme Detergent \[in progress\]
![ECo](/images/What%20We%20Do/For%20Environment/EcoEnzyme.jpg)
_EcoEnzyme lead: Ana Zeng (Industrial Design)_

The EcoEnzyme project aims to pilot the upcycling of fruit peel waste into a detergent that can be used as a cleaning agent in F&B premises. Piloted in Techno Edge canteen, the project trialled a step-by-step process to guide the fruit juice stallholder and cleaners in fermenting the fruit peels and turning it into detergent. The detergent is also undergoing numerous tests (e.g. microbial) on the level of efficacy as a cleaning agent. In addition, the project had engaged the community in creating their own upcycled detergent at home.  

Converting Waste to Resource: Upcycling Plastic Wastes to Street Furniture \[in progress\]

The team, Brambe, aims to design and produce street furniture by integrating upcycled plastic wastes and Jesmonite. Specifically, the team has designed a modular study table that allows reconfiguration for both individual use and group discussions, while considering the amount of material use and overall user experience. The team is in the midst of producing the tables and plans to trial them in an open study area in NUS.
