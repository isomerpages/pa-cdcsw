**Adopt @ South West**

Adopt @ South West was launched by the South West Community Development Council (CDC) in 2007 as a “many helping hands” approach to provide social support vulnerable residents with the assistance of corporate and community stakeholders. To date, Adopt @ South West has benefitted over 8,000 vulnerable households living across 24 Adopt @ South West precincts and in 29 rental blocks.

Building on the success of the programme, and as part of stepped-up efforts to strengthen the social safety net for the rental block residents, the programme was further enhanced to support needy families on assistance and residing in purchased flats. To date, the Adopt @ South West has supported about 500 families residing in purchased flats in eight divisions under Adopt @ South West. It is intended to target the vulnerable to lower middle-income families to help them maintain links with the community so that they do not feel socially isolated or fall through the cracks.

Festive Cheers @ South West an initiative under Adopt @ South West and is held during the festive seasons to bring cheers to everyone, especially the vulnerable, across South West District. From December to February, South West CDC would rally volunteers from our community and corporate partners to organise a series of festive activities and celebrations—ranging from social excursions, Christmas and Chinese New Year parties, back-to-school shopping for children, grant-a-wish, and distribution of festive cheers packs, to reach out to about 7,500 vulnerable residents across 29 rental blocks and 24 precincts under the Adopt @ South West programme.  

The objectives of Adopt @ South West are to:

* Uplift and enrich the lives of needy residents staying in rental to purchased flats;<br>
* Take a whole-of-community approach to better address needs on a sustained basis; and<br>
* Promote volunteerism &amp; philanthropy among individuals and organisations.
