**Festive Cheers @ South West**

A flagship initiative under Adopt @ South West that aims to spread joy to the underprivileged residents. In collaboration with our corporate and community partners and volunteers, a series of activities, ranging from social excursions, festive parties, grant-a-wish are organised any time of the year leading to the signature event of distribution of care packs to 8,000 units within South West District between December to February yearly.
