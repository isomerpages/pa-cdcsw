Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong launched the $130 million CDC Vouchers Scheme for all Singaporean households.

Up to 1.3 million Singaporean households will each receive $100 in CDC vouchers, which can be spent at all participating hawkers and heartland merchants. The scheme aims to support heartlands hawkers and merchants, as well as thank Singaporeans for their sense of solidarity during the pandemic.

Do note that only one member from each household will need to make the claim.

Assistance will be available at designated Community Centres / Residents' Committees, and priority shall be given to seniors without household members to help them claim their vouchers.

Residents without smartphones or who need to set up their Singpass or reset their Singpass password will also be assisted at the CCs during the Scheme duration. There will also be the option of printing hardcopy vouchers at the CCs.
