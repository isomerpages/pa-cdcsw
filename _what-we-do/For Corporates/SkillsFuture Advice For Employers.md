**SkillsFuture Advice For Employers**

The SkillsFuture movement was launched in 2016, to provide Singaporeans with the opportunities to develop their fullest potential throughout life; regardless of their starting points. A series of SkillsFuture Advice Workshops were rolled in 2017, in partnership with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), the 5 CDCs, Workforce Singapore (WSG), People's Association (PA) and Employment and Employability (e2i).

 AAIn the wake of Covid-19, the pandemic has ignited changes around the world and on the home front in Singapore. As we expect a shift in the overall economy, the job market and the way we work, we hope to inculcate the importance of skills upgrading, career planning and continuous lifelong learning .

We now offer complimentary physical and virtual SkillsFuture Advice Workshops and Webinars, to help corporates build a more resilient workforce to navigate the fast-changing environment. Through the sharing of relevant tips and information, employees can build resilience and adopt a growth mindset in these difficult times.
