Caregiving @ South West initiative aims to rally the community to Celebrate caregivers and caregiving; Support caregivers; and Empower a caring community, with the following desired outcomes:

*   Awareness and appreciation of caregiving;
*   More support and resources for caregivers; and
*   Build a caregiving network to provide care and support to caregivers and care recipients.

The initiative will address three aspects of caregiving:

1.  Celebrate Caregivers and Caregiving through increasing awareness and appreciation:  
*  Rolling out Caregiving @ South West roadshows across the South West District at community events, schools, shopping malls and healthcare institutions;
* Roving the Caregiver vending machine to educate and bring relevant information to the community 

2.  Support Caregivers with professional training, providing resources and services:
*   Curating educational resources on Caregiving;
*   Providing Caregiver Support Fund to defray Caregivers’ selfcare and caregiving expenses;
*   Providing opportunities for caregivers to have selfcare time through Caregiver Respite Day; and
*   Encouraging community and businesses to support caregiving.


3. Empower A Caring Community in areas of caregiving:

*   Engaging trained or past caregivers to volunteer as respite caregivers or serve as community caregivers (social employment); and
*   Organising Caregiving workshops and talks.
