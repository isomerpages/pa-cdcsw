Caregiving @ South West initiative aims to rally the community to Celebrate caregivers and caregiving; Support caregivers; and Empower a caring community, with the following desired outcomes:
- Awareness and appreciation of caregiving;
- More support and resources for caregivers; and
- Build a caregiving network to provide care and support to caregivers and care recipients. 

The initiative will address different aspects of caregiving in three phases over the 3 years:

1. Celebrate Caregivers and Caregiving
To celebrate caregiving through increasing awareness and appreciation:

* Rolled out 10 Caregiving @ South West roadshows across the South West District at community events, schools, shopping malls and healthcare institutions from January to December 2018;
* Wear the limited-edition Caregiving @ South West collar pin to show support for the caregivers; and
* Gift out Caregiving @ South West collar pins to caregivers to support and show appreciation to them.
 

2. Support Caregivers
To support caregivers in training, resources and services through creation of a seamless and conducive environment for caregivers:

* Develop Starter kits on caregiving for caregivers;
* Develop a local Community Directory of social support services for caregivers;
* Provide training subsidy for vulnerable caregivers; and
* Encourage community and businesses, such as SMEs, to support caregiving.
 

3. Empower A Caring Community
To empower our community in areas of caregiving:

* Engage trained or past caregivers to volunteer as respite caregivers or serve as community caregivers (social employment); and
* Organise activities in support of caregiving.
