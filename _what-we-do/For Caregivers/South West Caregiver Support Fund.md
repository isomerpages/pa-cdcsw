**Real Stories**<br>
Caregiving is a heavy and stressful responsibility for most people. Recognizing the need to reach out to caregivers, the South West CDC started the first district Caregiving @ South West programme.

Ms Nining Huttami is one of the beneficiaries of the Caregiver Support Fund. She is glad and grateful that the additional assistance and support she received from the community helped her pull through the most difficult time.
Three years ago, Ms Nining had to juggle with multiple responsibilities - caregiver to her 30-year-old elder sister who has cerebral palsy, sole breadwinner to the household of 3, and her studies at the polytechnic. For six years, Ms Nining would go to school, then work before going back home to care for her sister.

Referred by grassroots volunteers, Ms Nining received the Caregiver Support Fund of $500, an initiative by the South West CDC supported by Maybank. The fund is designed to supplement other schemes that provided more long-term assistance, and can be used to pay for out-of-pocket expenses. The money Ms Nining received was used to offset overdue medical bills and purchase of necessities such as diapers for her sister. This helped to lighten her financial burden so that she was able to focus on her studies.

Ms Nining is now happily married and looking back, she appreciates the community support that had helped her cope and complete her education when she was on the verge of giving up.
