**Other South West CDC Schemes & Bursaries**<br>
We work closely with schools and community partners to assist our needy students in their educational, transport and meal expenses through a myriad of bursaries such as the following:

**My Schooling Needs @ South West**<br>
My Schooling Needs @ South West was introduced in 2017 to provide under-privileged Kindergarten students in the South West District who are transitioning to primary school, with school bags, schooling accessories and stationary store vouchers. We work with several kindergartens in Singapore, including PAP Community Foundation Kindergartens, NTUC My First Skool and MOE Kindergarten to ensure deserving students benefitted from the programme.

**South West CDC-Koh Kock Leong (KKL) Meals Bursary**<br>
The South West CDC-KKL Meals Bursary was rolled out in 2008 to supplement meals for needy students in the South West District. We partner with Loving heart Multi-Service Centre, Primary, Secondary and Institute of Technical Education College West to recognise suitable students for this programme and provide a holistic assistance for them.

ExxonMobil Asia Pacific has partnered with South West CDC on the South West CDC-ExxonMobil Transport Bursary since 2006.
