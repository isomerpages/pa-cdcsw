**Health Qigong @ South West**

 The Health Qigong @ South West programme was launched in 2010, aimed to promote active ageing and healthy lifestyle in the South West District.

The qigong sessions encourage members to engage in regular qigong activities and forge bonds with family and friends. It is specially designed to create an enjoyable and conducive environment for healthy living in the district and enhance the appeal of exercising as a lifestyle and bonding activity.
