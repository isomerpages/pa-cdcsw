**Health Qigong @ South West**

The Health Qigong @ South West programme was launched in 2010, aimed to promote active ageing and healthy lifestyle in the South West District.  It is a popular interest group amongst South West residents, where the members engage in regular _qigong_ activities and forge bonds with family and friends. 

The _qigong_ sessions, these are specially designed to create an enjoyable and conducive environment for healthy living in the district and enhance the appeal of exercising as a lifestyle and bonding activity.

What’s more? It is open to EVERYONE!
