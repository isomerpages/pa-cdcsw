Organised by the South West CDC, HP Inc, and Junior Achievement (JA) Singapore, the Young Technopreneur Challenge seeks to empower youths to take ownership of the world they live in and become active problem solvers. This year, close to 150 students from 17 schools participated in the event. Congratulations to the winning teams from Raffles Girls School and Fuhua Secondary School!

Sustainability is one of the key focuses of South West CDC, and the Young Technopreneur Challenge 2022 promotes environment sustainability and green ownership among our youths. Congratulations once again to all the student participants and a big thank you to our partners on the success of Youth Technopreneur Challenge 2022!
