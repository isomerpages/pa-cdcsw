American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore (AmCham) and South West CDC distributed more than 400 care packs containing household necessities to vulnerable families in Jurong Central. The distribution took place as part of AmCham’s annual Corporate Community Day, which aims to build stronger ties with Singapore by giving back to the community.

This year’s distribution marked the third and final year of AmCham’s charity partnership with South West CDC, which has seen more than a thousand care packs distributed through the years.

Ms Low Yen Ling, Mayor of South West District remarked,“ We greatly value AmCham’s partnership which sees AmCham members standing in solidarity with South West CDC and our vulnerable residents. With many helping hands, we’re able to uplift lives and weave a strong social fabric in our district to meet the challenges of the pandemic together. The care pack gifts go beyond meeting physical needs and speak volumes of the strong friendship AmCham has with Singapore, and how our communities are rallying behind each other as we move towards the post-pandemic new normal.”
