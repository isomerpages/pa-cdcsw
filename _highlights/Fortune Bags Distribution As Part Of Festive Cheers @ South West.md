40 volunteers from SAGE Counselling Centre, Boon Lay Grassroots Organisations (GROs), NTUÂ  University Advancement Office, and Thye Hua Kwan Family Service Centre @ Jurong distributed the South West Festive Cheers packs to vulnerable households in Boon Lay, Hong Kah North and Bukit Gombak divisions on 29 January 2022 as part of Festive Cheers @ South West. The volunteers were also joined by Minister Desmond Lee and Mayor Low Yen Ling as they went door-to-door to spread festive cheer to the residents. The packs are bundled with 2,000 Fortune Bags comprising festive items, daily essentials and health products, specially provided by SAGE Counselling Centre.
