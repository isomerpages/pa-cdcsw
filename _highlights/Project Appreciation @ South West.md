South West CDC partnered Project Wellness, a ground up initiative, and Nanyang Technological University’s Alumni Club to provide appreciation care packs for 5,000 healthcare workers from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Jurong Community Hospital and St Luke’s Hospital as part of Project Appreciation @ South West. The initiative is supported by Guardian Singapore, P&G Singapore and Jurong and Yuan Ching Secondary Schools.

The care packs included personal hygiene essentials, face masks, hand sanitizer, multi-vitamins as well as TraceTogether pouches or tissue pouches handmade by volunteers from Project Wellness and handmade greeting cards with well wishes penned by students from Jurong and Yuan Ching Secondary Schools. The care packs were specially curated for the healthcare staff to keep themselves safe and healthy while attending to the needs of the patients.

Ms Low Yen Ling, Mayor of South West District said, “COVID-19 has placed extraordinary stress on healthcare workers - from worry and exhaustion, to the fear of infecting their loved ones. They bore the brunt of the pandemic and shielded us with their care and dedication. These 5,000 care packs are a gesture of our heartfelt appreciation to thank them for their tireless work and sacrifices. Without them holding the fort, we wouldn't have been able to keep healthcare services up and running. The community recognises their tremendous contributions in keeping our nation safe, and together, we hope to bring them encouragement by showing our care for them.”
