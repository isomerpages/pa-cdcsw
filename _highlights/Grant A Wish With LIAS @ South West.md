We wrapped up our annual Festive Cheers @ South West programme on 6 March 2022!

From December 2021 to March 2022, over 1,000 volunteers and more than 90 community and corporate partners came together to bring joy and cheer to 7,500 vulnerable households through the Festive Cheers @ South West programme.  Together, our corporate and community partners contributed more than $677,000 to the programme. 

To meet the varied needs of the residents, a more targeted approach was adopted by giving items based on residents’ needs and preferences. For the wrap-up event, we partnered Landscape Industry Association (Singapore) (LIAS) to present specially curated gifts and Festive Cheers packs to seniors at REACH Senior Centre @ Bukit Gombak Vista.

Thank You to all our partners for uplifting and enriching the lives of the needy residents in the South West District!
