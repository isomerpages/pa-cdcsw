3M Tinkering Headstart @ South West
===================================

![3M](/images/Highlights/3M%20hr.jpg)

3M Tinkering Headstart @ South West is a partnership between 3M Singapore, Science Centre Singapore and South West Community Development Council. The students from Big Heart Student Care had a blast tinkering under the guidance of volunteers from 3M Singapore and Science Centre Singapore!

One of the students who attended the workshop shared, “Through the workshop, I learnt how to make my own car and use sunlight to control it. Science is one of my favourite subjects because I get to do exciting experiments with my friends. I see a lot of science experiments on YouTube that look really fun too and want to try them when I get older!”
