The SkillsFuture Festival featured learning and job opportunities in three key growth economies: Digital, Green and Care economies. Residents participated in hands-on demonstrations and gained first-hand experience of jobs in the three economies. The activities included an immersive tour of the Operating Theatre using the V360 technology, demonstrations by the Emergency Medical Technicians on an ambulance, as well as the future roles of drones in the Green economy.
