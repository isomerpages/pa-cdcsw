The Community Guiding Programme is an initiative that engages young girls in developing their leadership and life skills through a series of workshops such as craft making, building of self-confidence, bento-making and elderly befriending. The girls were all smiles when they received their graduation certificates from Mayor Low and Mrs Koh-Teh Yi Wen, Chief Commissioner, Girl Guides Singapore.

Following the successful pilot, the Community Guiding Programme will be extended to other divisions in the South West District, to provide more girls with the opportunity to develop useful life skills and leadership skills.

Thank you Girl Guides Singapore for your support in reaching out to young girls in the South West community!
