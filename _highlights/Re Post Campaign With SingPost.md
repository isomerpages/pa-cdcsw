South West CDC partnered with Singapore Post (SingPost) and three social enterprises for the Re:Post charity campaign to upcycle decommissioned old SingPost uniforms and transform them into lifestyle products, in a bid to benefit the environment as well as communities such as the lower income and the elderly.

The sales of the proceeds will be fully donated to South West CDC to support vulnerable residents through the following programmes:

South West Caregiver Support Fund provides a one-time $500 grant to caregivers to defray their self-care and caregiving expenses
Meals Service @ South West provides immobile residents with additional meal subsidies
The products are on sale at 15 selected post offices, all philatelic stores, as well as on shop.singpost.com and via the SingPost mobile app.
