South West CDC partnered ExxonMobil to present Gifts of Love to over 1,000 vulnerable families in 5 Boon Lay rental blocks. Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Adviser to Boon Lay Grassroots Organisations and Ms Low Yen Long, Mayor of South West District joined ExxonMobil staff and volunteers in the distribution. The care pack included a mixture of grocery and sundry items, and the South West Caregiving Care Guide self-assessment checklist and mental health resources for residents.

Aside from the gift pack, over 100 students in these rental blocks who were given transport bursary worth up to $150, also received a stationery pack. ExxonMobil volunteers also wrote motivational notes encouraging the students to stay happy and healthy during such times.
