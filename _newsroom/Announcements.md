**CDC Vouchers Scheme**  
  
The CDC Vouchers Scheme was launched by DPM Heng Swee Keat and the five Mayors on 12 June 2020. This is part of the Unity and Resilience Budgets 2020, aimed to benefit up to 400,000 Singaporean households by supporting them with daily expenses and boosting the businesses of our local merchants and hawkers at HDB estates/heartlands.

Each identified household will receive $50 worth of CDC vouchers that can be redeemed for food and essential goods and services at participating local merchants e.g. hawker stalls, wet markets, mom-and-pop stalls. Notification letters will be mailed out to the identified households and voucher collection will be progressively rolled out to ensure safe distancing at the Community Clubs/Centres.

Merchants who wish to participate in the above initiative, please submit your interest viaÂ [http://go.gov.sg/sw-cdcvoucherscheme](http://go.gov.sg/sw-cdcvoucherscheme).
