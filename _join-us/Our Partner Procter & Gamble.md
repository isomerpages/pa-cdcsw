Over the years, P&G has tapped on its resources to meet the varied needs of residents in the South West District.

For residents of South West District, global consumer goods company P&G is synonymous with household, grooming and oral care products that have seen them through good and bad times. Thanks to an ongoing partnership with the South West Community Development Council (CDC), P&G has been uplifting their lives through their engagement initiatives and donations of personal care essentials.

P&G first partnered the South West CDC in 2019, when it came on board for Festive Cheers @ South West — an annual programme to bring cheer to vulnerable residents from Adopt @ South West precincts during the year-end holiday period. As part of Festive Cheers @ South West, P&G provided various products in the festive care packs that are distributed to the vulnerable residents. Its staff also volunteered  in putting together and distributing these packs.

Under this programme, the company runs Festive Grant-A-Wish as part of its annual corporate social responsibility efforts. This initiative is aimed at fulfilling the wishes of underprivileged children aged between seven and 11. Sponsored by P&G staff, these gifts comprise of school supplies, sports equipment, board games, art and craft materials and learning materials. Festive Grant-A-Wish has benefitted 100 young residents in 2019 and another 200 in 2020. In 2021, the initiative was expanded to include 300 seniors.

As part of last year’s Festive Cheers @ South West, P&G staff also pooled together resources to purchase study tables, chairs, bookshelves and other furniture for 20 households to create a more conducive home learning environment for vulnerable students.

Since the start of the pandemic, P&G has actively contributed to South West CDC’s COVID-19-related initiatives. In the early days of the pandemic, the company joined hands with other corporate and community partners to encourage frontline workers in the healthcare and transport sectors with specially put-together South West Care Packs. Containing items such as vitamins, homemade drinks, fruits and hand sanitisers, the packs were meant to help boost the frontliners’ immunity and complement their personal hygiene efforts. The company also partnered South West CDC and the Ministry of Manpower to supply personal health and hygiene items worth some $5 million in total to migrant workers, and household cleaning products to the dormitories to help migrant workers maintain a clean and safe living environment.

As the circuit breaker measures eased, P&G donated 500 sets of cleaning products to help preschools and social service agencies prepare their spaces for the return of children and seniors respectively. Extending its efforts to promote clean and safe environments, it educated 7,500 children on proper handwashing techniques and good hygiene habits in the Safe Schools handwashing initiative under Healthy Schools @ South West, a programme that promotes healthy habits among primary school students.

Frontliners continued to benefit from P&G’s unwavering support, with the company contributing to 2,000 care packs for frontliners in the health, education and transport sectors in June 2020 and 5,000 care packs for healthcare workers during last year’s Project Appreciation @ South West.
