A home-grown job portal with more than 11,000 job vacancies was launched on Friday, 24 September 2021, at the South West Community Job Fair held at Jurong Spring Community Club. It was launched by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Adviser to Jurong GRC GROs (Taman Jurong).

The portal offers jobs from more than 600 employers across different sectors, including positions for both PMET and non-PMET roles. Known as ‘qood’, the portal helps job seekers write resumes and shortlist employers. This is a local FREE-TO-USE platform for all Employers and Job Seekers. No hidden charges. There are more than 11,000 jobs in the database and there is one job waiting for you to bring it home.
