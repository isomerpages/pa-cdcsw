To bring cheer to those affected in the South West District, Girl Guides Singapore (GGS) partnered the South West Community Development Council (CDC) and Koh Kock Leong Enterprise to distribute halal-certified cookies to 3,500 households over the National Day period.

Mayor of South West District Ms Low Yen Ling said, “As we celebrate our nation’s birthday, it is also an opportune time to show that every Singaporean matters. These gifts of cookies and care packs bear a message of love, care and hope — that no one is alone in these difficult times. This joint initiative between Girl Guides Singapore, Koh Kock Leong Enterprise and South West CDC to uplift our vulnerable residents is a testament of the community’s solidarity to stand together and support one another through this crisis.”
