**Leading The Charge To Meet Needs**

For Mr Anthony Tan, PBM, serving others is not a “do it only when I am free” activity but a part of his life. “I get great joy from serving others, especially when I see the satisfaction on the faces of fellow members and the beneficiaries we help,” he shares. “I was inspired to give back when I witnessed the dedication of those who came before me. They were very committed to making a difference in their communities and I wanted to do the same,” he adds, describing a journey that began seven years ago.

From these pioneers, Mr Tan, 47, learnt the importance of rallying the entire community, including residents, schools, corporates and social service agencies to help others. This whole-of-community approach is especially important in a place like the South West District, home to many multinational corporations and homegrown businesses. “These organisations, however, may not know how to help or know where help is needed. That is where the South West Community Development Council (CDC) comes in,” explains Mr Tan, who works in the media industry. “We have our ears on the ground and know the needs of residents, so we can facilitate community support and enrichment.”

This is precisely what he does as the Chairman of the South West CDC’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Functional Committee, a role he assumed in 2017. With his leadership and the support of his fellow councillors, corporate sponsors have contributed generously towards various South West CDC’s assistance schemes and programmes over the past financial year despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.

For his efforts to rally the community to give back, Mr Tan received the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) at this year’s National Day Awards. “I must thank Mayor Low Yen Ling, my fellow District Councillors, the staff at the South West CDC and all the other volunteers I work with. Their support has been invaluable and this win is a team effort.”
