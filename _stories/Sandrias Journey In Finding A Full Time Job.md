**Sandria’s Journey In Finding A Full-Time Job**

59 year-old Sandria was working part time at a chain supermarket previously. She was looking out for permanent job to boost her income but her efforts was in vain.  Amidst her search for full time job,  she was referred to South West CDC District Councillor, Ms Jenny Wee who is also qood Community Outreach Advisor. Jenny helped Sandria with writing her resume and posted it on the qood job portal (qood.com.sg). Within weeks, Sandria received calls from more than five companies who called her for interviews. She accepted the full-time job offer as a sales executive at Far East Flora and is happy and grateful to those who have helped her find full-time employment. From being unable to find full-time employment to being called up by more than five companies for job interviews, Sandria is amazed that the qood job portal is effective and useful for someone like her. Her supervisor at Far East Flora is also happy that Sandria is a proactive employee who does her work with pride and goes above and beyond what is required of her in her job.
