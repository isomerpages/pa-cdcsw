**Awards & Accolades**<br>
Championing sustainability has always been a key focus for the South West District. Staying true to the district’s rich green heritage in parks and nature reserves, the South West Community Development Council (CDC) has developed programmes to nurture an environmentally conscious community that adopts an eco-friendly lifestyle. Collectively, we have rolled out some 90 environmental and community programmes, reaching out to over 700,000 residents through the support of volunteers, schools, community and corporate partners.

Some of these initiatives include annual recycling drives, environmental carnival and roadshows to raise awareness of climate change, ideation sessions for youth, school-based programmes to inculcate green values from young, and community gardens to green the community.

Our district’s long-standing dedication and commitment to sustainability has led us to win several awards at local and international levels, as follows:
