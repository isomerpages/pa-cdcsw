The Community Development Councils (CDCs) were established under the Peopleâ€™s Association Act in 1997. Subsequently, the South West Community Development Council (CDC) was formed on 24 November 2001 with the mission to Assist the Needy, Bond the People and Connect the Community. 

The CDC brings together government agencies, grassroots organisations (GROs), social service agencies (SSAs) and the private sector to strengthen the social fabric of Singapore. Through our programmes and initiatives, the CDC promotes social cohesion and encourages community ownership among residents, community and corporate partners.  

Ms Low Yen Ling was appointed the Mayor of South West District on 27 May 2014. Ms Low is also the Minister of State, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) & Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) & Adviser to Chua Chu Kang GRC.
